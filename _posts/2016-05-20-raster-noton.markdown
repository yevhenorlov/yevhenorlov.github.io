...we need to survive [laughs], because it's our lives. It's not only a company, it's really a vision for a whole life. You could call Raster-Noton a record label or a company, but in the end, for us, it's much more like a platform to do what we want to do. I think it survived because it's not a maximum profit-based idea. We want to release our music or music that we find interesting. 

...We saw this with Mille Plateaux, for instance, where at some point they released four records every week. I think it was part of the problem they created on their own. We said, "We have a very limited audience, we would like that everybody is able to buy the CD. Let's not put out four CDs a week. Let's put out one CD a month." So then people can still follow, and on a real budget it's OK to buy one. Until today, we have releases that sell around 1000 copies. 

...we all have a very big backbone in visual arts. And if you look from the visual arts side, an artist's career as we know the classic artist career, they work on one topic their whole life. They have their creative style. So for us, it was actually more normal that you create a kind of style, and that you stick with this style and you work on one topic. 

...the main thing is that we're trying to develop a language over the years of what we are. You say, you've worked all these years and you worked inside developing your own language. As a label we've done that. And I think this is a pure artistic idea.
