    <p>“…You know that feeling when you hear a really amazing song and your hairs go up on your body? Colundi is that feeling all the time. It’s… it’s so amazing. So amazing.” He hesitates for a long time. “Also very, very difficult to put into words.”</p>

<p>…A self-described “country bumpkin,” he thinks the common ground is upbringing. Just as Wilson-Claridge and Richard D. James reimagined techno in remote Cornwall, Perälä’s encounters with the second summer of love, via Finnish radio at the age of 12, were influenced by his rural location.</p>

<p>“That’s the whole beauty,” he says. “Because you hear only a few tracks that define the genre for you. And you want to hear more but you can’t. You can tape some stuff off the radio but not enough. So that’s what made me want to start making music. To fill in the gaps.”</p>

<p>…Perälä was keen to share his discoveries, demonstrating on <a href="http://www.ovuca.com/research.html">his site</a> how he constructed a series of equal temperament scales, dividing the octave into an increasing number of equally spaced steps. “It all started from 33hz and then built up from that,” he explains. “From just one frequency per octave, I went to using two frequencies per octave, then three, four, five all the way up to 32.”</p>

<p>…Perälä’s epiphany is like any epiphany: utterly real to the person who experienced it, incomprehensible to those who didn’t. The difference with Colundi is that it’s also produced some extraordinary music.</p>
